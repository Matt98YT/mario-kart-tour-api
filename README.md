# Mario Kart Tour API
## https://mario-kart-tour-api.glitch.me

A project used to scrape the leaderboard on Mario Kart Tour.

This project uses the excellent html parsing library [cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/)
to, using the least amount of effort possible, construct an api of the Mario Kart Tour
data. I came across the data embedded in their html and couldn't help myself, 
so here we are. 

Is this useful? Not particularly in and of itself, but I'm always looking for simple, 
interesting examples to walk through in the [classes that I teach](https://cooper.edu/art/news/learn-how-destroy-internet),
and this fit the bill.

If you find this interesting, let me know in the tweets. If you have a feature request, submit a ~~pull-request~~ [Glitch](https://glitch.com/~mario-kart-tour-api) remix.
